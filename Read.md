This terraform script is for spinning up infrastructure in aws. Resources are continuosly being added to the account, so these scripts will keep on changing.

Make sure to generate your own access key and secret key for accessing terraform created instances (key name = mykey & mykey.pub).

Configure your own aws cli environment using your iam credentials.
